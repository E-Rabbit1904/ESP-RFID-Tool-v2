  * ESP-RFID-Tool-v2: https://github.com/Einstein2150/ESP-RFID-Tool-v2/releases  
  * Releases are compiled with esp8266 board manager package 2.4.0  
 
## improved features compared to the original version 

### UI 2.0
  * modern user interface
  * optimised for mobile devices (i.e. bigger buttons than small textlinks)

### replay 2.0
  * MOSFET's ground the DATA-lines while **replaying data more stable than the original board** can do
  * new **direct-replay-feature** in the log. Pick your capture and replay it with one click! (field-tested with Wiegand-34bit and keypad)

### Status page  
  * new **status-page** with useful informations:
   * 	Wiegand-wiring-check
   *   Device Uptime
   *   Memory informations
  
### Hex-Magic in captured data
  * the logfile now lists the **cleaned HEX of the card** (free of control bits-data)
  * for **RFID-cards the UID is calculated** and printed in the log. This makes the creation of clonecards more easy

## schematic and wiring for board-v2 (based on nodemcu)  
* board-v2 could be easily build by yourself:

<img src="Images/board-v2 back.png" alt="Frontend" width="300"/>
<img src="Images/board-v2 uncovered.png" alt="Frontend" width="300"/>

* it has an additional voltage regulator for higher voltage
* board-v2 uses 2 MOSFET (i.e. 2N7000) for replay-attacks which makes the ability of stronger comunication because the Wiegand datalines get strong grounded
*  you can use the ESP-RFID-Tool-v2 firmware on the original board from Corey Harding but it wouldn't have the improvements because they relie on additional hardware.

This is the preferred board design with uses a 7805 5V voltage regulator for feeding the esp by the vin-pin which is regulated by the nodemcu-own voltage regulator to 3.3V which should be safe until 25V:

Alternative:

If you know your voltage ratings you can use a 3.3 voltage regulator like the 1117 too but it should not be more than 15V.

You are always free to power the nodemcu natively by the VIN-pin but be sure not to exceed 9V for the nodemcu:

## What is it?  
A universal data logger that captures the raw binary data from a standard 5V Wiegand Interface. The device is capable of logging the credentials for access control systems or nearly any device that utilizes a Wiegand Interface such as RFID card readers, pin pads, magnetic stripe systems, barcode, and even some biometric readers. Wiegand Interfaces also do not have to be limited to just access control systems. The main target group for this device is 26-37bit HID cards.  For known card types both the binary and hexadecimal data is displayed directly in the log file for easy badge identification and also in case a clone of a card may be needed. For unknown card types only the raw binary data is shown.  
  
## How do you install it?  
The device may be installed directly into an existing system drawing its power from the preexisting wiring or it can also be used to turn a reader into a standalone portable unit for data logging when a battery is added. Wiring is simple and consists of 4 wires, (+), (-), D0(Green), and D1(White). The device is capable of operating on voltages ranging from around 4.5V up to a maximum of 12v. Commonly found voltages are 12V and 5V. **(See Installation Notes Below)  
  
## How do you access the logs?  
Access to the log files and various settings is provided via a web based interface. The device has WiFi capabilities and can be set up to spawn its own access point or set to connect to an existing network. In the event you get locked out of the web interface you can bridge the J3 jumper on power up or while resetting the device to regain access without losing your log files.  
  
## I want to know a little more...
The hardware is based on an ESP12 WiFi chip with a full TCP/IP stack and Microcontroller Unit. The software is open source licensed under the MIT License and will be released the day the product is launched. The software will reside in this GitHub repo so it may be reviewed by the community. We will accept various pull requests from the community after being reviewed if it improves the value of the device for others. The software was written in the Arduino IDE so both hobbyist and professionals will have no issue modifying the code if they so choose.  A Wiegand Interface operates using 3 wires, a ground, Data0, and Data1. A zero is sent when D0 goes low and a one is sent when D1 goes low, the other line remains high during this time. The timing is 40uS from low to high on a line with 2mS between bits. The software logs this binary output to a file and if the device thinks it is a known card format the preamble is guessed(not sent by card reader but it is the same for all cards of a specific format, our primary target is 26-37bit HID cards) and both the raw binary and hexadecimal data is logged. For unkown card formats only the raw binary output is logged with no guess at the preamble and without showing the data in hexadecimal format to prevent confusion. If you know what kind of card was captured, simply look up the preamble and add it to the beginning of the binary then typically convert it to hexadecimal format to make a clone of a card. It is possible the card is actually an unknown format and the preamble was guessed incorrectly with the device thinking it was a known card format(the guess is based on the bit count output by the reader), if this is the case in the log file there is a literal space in the binary between the preamble and the card data, simply ignore the preamble. When replaying a captured credential*(see note below) you do not include the preamble as that is not output by the card reader but instead you only replay*(see note below) the actual card data as output from the reader. You only need to worry about the preamble if making a clone of a card. The primary function of this device is for logging the raw binary data as output from a Wiegand Interface. You can read from 1 bit all the way up to 4,096 bits. The default buffer setting only allows 52 bits and must be manually increased from the settings page accessible from the web interface.  
  
## TX Mode  
With the board-v2 you can transmit Wiegand-data with full power because the MOSFETs drop the data-lines hard to ground. But be aware. There is a risk when the device is in TX mode and the output goes low. If the device is also receiving data during this time there will be a short. For this reason be sure that absoulutely no cards are being scanned while the device is in TX mode. The device does not go into TX mode until you press on a form submit button and as soon as the data is done being transmitted it goes back into listening mode. 
  
## **Installation Notes  
[Click here for wiring diagrams](Installation-Schematics/README.md)  
[Click here to see connector options](/Connector-Adapter-Options/README.md)  
* Make sure the reader outputs data in the Wiegand format  
* Connect D0 on device to D0 on reader  
* Connect D1 on device to D1 on reader  
* Connect + on device to + on reader  
* Connect - on device to - on reader  

* The ESP-RFID-Tool-v2 based on nodemcu with an external 5v voltage regulator accepts 7-25v
* If you use the external 3.3v voltage regulator you should not exceed 15v

* At a minimum D0, D1, and GND(-) must be connected to the reader for proper function, no matter the power source.
* You can check the wiring on the status-page of the device
